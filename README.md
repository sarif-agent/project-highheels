A High Heel Commercial Website

A store website I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also added an extra blog section. Some parts were quite challenging. Unfortunately, there is no functional search box or payment system. This is the best I could do for now. (I don't know back-end LOL). 

I got all the images from the Pexels website, and most of them are by the artist Karolina Grabowska. I generated all the product images by providing prompts to DALL-E. 

 I plan to use this site for my freelance projects in the future.
